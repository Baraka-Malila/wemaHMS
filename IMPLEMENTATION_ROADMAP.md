# üöÄ WEMA HMS - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-02
**Current Status**: 60% Complete
**Critical Bug Blocking**: Finance portal pending payments visibility

---

## üìä **CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS**

### ‚úÖ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL (75%+)**
1. **Reception Portal** - Patient registration, check-in, file fee processing
2. **Admin Portal** - Staff management, user approvals, system monitoring
3. **Doctor Dashboard** - Overview, patient statistics, monitoring
4. **Doctor Queue** - FIFO patient processing, consultation initiation
5. **Authentication** - Role-based login, token management, session handling
6. **Patient Management** - Auto-ID generation, status tracking, cross-portal sharing

### üîÑ **PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL (30-70%)**
1. **Doctor Portal** (60%)
   - ‚úÖ Dashboard, Queue, Consultation start
   - ‚ùå Diagnosis recording, Prescription creation, Lab requests (mock data)

2. **Finance Portal** (40%)
   - ‚úÖ Backend APIs for payments, pricing
   - ‚ùå Frontend UI incomplete, pending payments not visible (BUG)

3. **Pharmacy Portal** (30%)
   - ‚úÖ Backend APIs for dispensing, inventory
   - ‚ùå Frontend mostly mock, no real API integration

4. **Lab Portal** (25%)
   - ‚úÖ Backend APIs for test results, requests
   - ‚ùå Frontend not implemented, no queue management

5. **Nursing Portal** (20%)
   - ‚úÖ Backend APIs for patient care, wards
   - ‚ùå Frontend skeleton only, no real functionality

### ‚ùå **NOT FUNCTIONAL (<20%)**
- Advanced reporting
- Real-time notifications (UI exists but no backend)
- Mobile optimization
- Data export/import
- Audit logging UI

## üêõ **CRITICAL BUGS TO FIX IMMEDIATELY**

### **BUG #1: Finance Pending Payments Not Visible** (BLOCKING)
**Status**: Discovered today, blocking Scenario A testing

**Problem**:
- Backend has 13 pending payments in database
- Finance API `/api/finance/payments/pending/` returns only 2
- Payments created yesterday (2025-10-01) not showing today (2025-10-02)
- Suspected date filtering issue

**Impact**: **BLOCKS ENTIRE WORKFLOW** - Patients cannot complete payment after consultation

**Files to Fix**:
- `/backend/finance/views.py` - `pending_payments()` method (line 497-504)
- `/frontend/src/app/finance/daily-ops/page.tsx` - Frontend payment list
- `/backend/finance/utils.py` - Date filtering logic

**Solution Strategy**:
1. Check if `pending_payments()` applies default date filter
2. Remove date filter from pending payments (show ALL pending regardless of date)
3. Update frontend to properly display consultation vs lab payments
4. Test with Scenario A patient flow

**Priority**: üî• **HIGHEST** - Fix before any other development

---

### **BUG #2: Real-time Clock Component** (MINOR)
**Status**: Fixed in previous session

**Problem**: Static time display, doesn't update in real-time
**Solution**: Implemented `useEffect` with `setInterval`, working correctly
**Priority**: ‚úÖ Resolved
