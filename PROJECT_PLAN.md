# WEMA-HMS Project Plan

## 1. Refactor Frontend Structure
- Restructure `frontend/src/` for modular portals and reusable components.
- Integrate Visily-generated components, refactoring into reusable UI.
- Adhere strictly to design files in `/DESIGNS/frontend-designs/`.
- Set up ESLint, Prettier, and enforce code style.

## 2. Set Up Backend Foundation
- Initialize Django project in `backend/` with modular apps.
- Configure PostgreSQL, Redis, DRF, drf-yasg.
- Add Docker setup for local development.
- Apply 12-factor app principles and best practices.
- Prepare for local LAN deployment.

## 3. Prepare Authentication Module
- Wait for user instructions before implementing.
- Plan for robust frontend and backend auth integration.

## General Best Practices
- Modular code structure, environment variables, tests, documentation, centralized logging, DRY code.

Next Steps:
1. Begin frontend refactoring and setup.
2. Set up backend foundation.
3. Move to authentication module (frontend, then backend) as per user instructions.
