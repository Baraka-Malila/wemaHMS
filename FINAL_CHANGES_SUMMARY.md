## 📊 Mock Data Review Results

### ✅ Finance Portal
- **Dashboard**: ✅ Real API integration (completed in Phase 2)
- **Payment History**: ✅ Real API integration (existing)
- **Daily Ops**: ⚠️ Contains placeholder mock data for expenses and outstanding bills

**Daily Ops Mock Data Status**:
```typescript
// Line 29-126: Mock data for demonstration
const dailyBalance = { /* mock stats */ };
const expenses = [ /* mock expenses */ ];
const outstandingBills = [ /* mock bills */ ];
```

**Note**: This is **intentional placeholder data** for the expenses and bills sections. The payment-related data pulls from real APIs. These sections will be integrated when Expense Management and Billing modules are implemented.

## 🐛 Known Issues to Debug

### Issue 1: Tab Counts Display
**Problem**: "Pending and recent payments are all set at 0 till they are clicked"
**Location**: Payment History page tabs
**Status**: ⏳ Pending debugging
**Possible Causes**:
- Initial state not fetching on page load
- Polling interval not starting until tab clicked
- API response format issue

### Issue 2: Payments Appearing in Wrong Tab
**Problem**: "Consultation fees appear in recent while none has passed through pending"
**Status**: ⏳ Pending debugging
**Explanation**:
- File fees: Created as PAID (expected - Option 1)
- Old consultations: May have been created before auto-creation implementation
- New consultations: Should create PENDING payments (test needed)

---

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Payment Creation
```bash
# SSH into backend
docker compose exec backend python manage.py shell

# Check payment counts
from finance.models import ServicePayment
print(f"Total payments: {ServicePayment.objects.count()}")
print(f"Pending: {ServicePayment.objects.filter(status='PENDING').count()}")
print(f"Paid: {ServicePayment.objects.filter(status='PAID').count()}")

# Check recent payments
recent = ServicePayment.objects.order_by('-created_at')[:5]
for p in recent:
    print(f"{p.id} | {p.service_type} | {p.status} | {p.created_at}")
```

### 2. Test Complete Flow
1. Register new patient (should create PAID file fee)
2. Doctor completes consultation (should create PENDING consultation payment)
3. Check Payment History - Pending tab (should show consultation)
4. Process payment (should move to Completed tab)

### 3. Check Console Logs
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Navigate to Payment History page
- Check Console tab for API responses
- Look for errors or unexpected data formats

### Finance Dashboard
```
GET /api/finance/payments/?status=PAID&date={selectedDate}  # For stats

```

### Payment History Page
