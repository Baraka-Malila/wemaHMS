## 🔄 WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### ✅ Scenario A: Consultation + Medications (COMPLETE)
**Flow:** Patient → Doctor (Consultation) → Finance (Pay consultation + medications) → Pharmacy (Dispense)

**Status:**
- ✅ Doctor completes consultation with prescriptions
- ✅ System creates PENDING consultation payment (5,000 TZS)
- ✅ System creates PENDING medication payment (calculated from prescriptions)
- ✅ Both payments appear in Finance pending queue
- ✅ Finance can process both payments
- ✅ Payment history tracking works
- ✅ Patient status updates correctly

**Test Results:** ✅ PASSED - Full workflow tested and working

---

### ✅ Scenario B: Consultation + Lab Tests (COMPLETE)
**Flow:** Patient → Doctor (Consultation) → Finance (Pay consultation + lab tests) → Lab (Perform tests)

**Status:**
- ✅ Doctor completes consultation with lab test requests
- ✅ System creates PENDING consultation payment (5,000 TZS)
- ✅ System creates PENDING lab payment (calculated from selected tests)
- ✅ Lab payment correctly calculates individual test prices:
  - 1 test (MRDT): 8,000 TZS
  - 12 tests: ~150,000 TZS (varies by tests selected)
- ✅ Both payments appear in Finance pending queue
- ✅ Finance can process payments
- ✅ All 27 frontend lab test IDs properly mapped to backend
- ✅ Payment history tracking works

**Test Results:** ✅ PASSED - Full workflow tested and working

---

### ⚠️ Scenario C: Full Workflow (PENDING)
**Flow:** Patient → Doctor (Consultation + Lab + Meds) → Finance (Pay all) → Lab (Tests) → Doctor (Review results) → Finance (Pay meds) → Pharmacy (Dispense)

**Status:**
- ✅ Consultation completion works
- ✅ Payment creation works
- ✅ Finance payment processing works
- ⚠️ **MISSING:** Lab portal frontend to receive paid test requests
- ⚠️ **MISSING:** Lab results entry and recording
- ⚠️ **MISSING:** Doctor review of lab results workflow
- ⚠️ **MISSING:** Pharmacy portal frontend to receive paid prescriptions
- ⚠️ **MISSING:** Medication dispensing workflow

**Next Steps:**
1. Build Lab portal frontend (test request queue, results entry)
2. Build Pharmacy portal frontend (prescription queue, dispensing)
3. Implement patient routing after payment (to Lab AND/OR Pharmacy)
4. Test complete end-to-end workflow

---

## 🐛 BUGS FIXED (Session Summary)

### Critical Bugs Resolved:
1. ✅ **Consultation duplication error** - Backend now returns existing consultation instead of error
2. ✅ **Lab request creation failing** - Fixed status field (REQUESTED vs PENDING)
3. ✅ **Lab test ID mapping incomplete** - All 27 tests now mapped correctly
4. ✅ **Lab payment fixed at 25,000 TZS** - Now calculates from actual test prices
5. ✅ **Payment history blinking** - Fixed with useMemo to prevent re-renders
6. ✅ **TypeScript errors** - Fixed type assertions in payment history
7. ✅ **Registration error handling** - Better user-friendly error messages
8. ✅ **Lab request serializer** - Properly handles consultation_id to ForeignKey conversion

### Performance Improvements:
- ✅ Payment history page: 2-second refresh without blinking
- ✅ Finance dashboard: Optimized polling with ID comparison
- ✅ Doctor queue: Real-time updates without UI flicker
