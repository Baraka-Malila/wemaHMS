# 🏥 WEMA HMS - Claude Development Kickstart

Hello Claude! Welcome to the WEMA Hospital Management System development project. 

## 🎯 **Project Context**
You're joining a **70% complete hospital management system** built with **Django REST + Next.js 15 + PostgreSQL**. The foundation is solid, and we need your expertise to complete the remaining 30% efficiently.

## 📋 **Essential Reading (Please review these files first)**
1. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Complete development context, rules, and workflow patterns
2. **`CRITICAL_BUGS.md`** - Two critical bugs that need fixing before heavy development  
3. **`BACKEND_REVIEW.md`** - Current API status and available endpoints
4. **`PATIENT_API_DOCS.md`** - Patient workflow API documentation

## 🚀 **Your Mission: Complete the Hospital Management System**

### **Immediate Priority: Foundation Fixes (Start Here)**
1. **Fix Bug #2**: Replace static dashboard clocks with real-time updating components
2. **Fix Bug #1**: Resolve multi-tab authentication confusion 

### **Primary Development: Patient Journey Completion**
Follow the hospital workflow from Reception → Doctor → Lab → Pharmacy → Nursing → Finance

## 🎵 **Key Mantras** (From the team)
- **"We use REAL APIs, not mock data!"** - Always integrate with actual backend endpoints
- **"We already have modals - REUSE them!"** - Leverage existing components  
- **"Hospitals work FIFO, not random!"** - Implement proper medical workflow logic
- **"TypeScript errors? Fix them NOW!"** - Never ignore compilation errors

## 🏗️ **Current System Strengths**
✅ Complete authentication system  
✅ All portal layouts and navigation  
✅ Database models and API structure  
✅ Design system and UI consistency  
✅ Docker containerization  

## 🎯 **Starting Point**
Begin with the critical bug fixes in `CRITICAL_BUGS.md`, then proceed to Reception Portal patient registration completion.
