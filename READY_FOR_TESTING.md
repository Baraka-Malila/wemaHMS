## üîç Debugging Commands

### Check Backend Logs
```bash
docker compose logs backend --tail=100 -f
```

### Check Database
```bash
docker compose exec backend python manage.py shell
```

```python
from finance.models import ServicePayment
from patients.models import Patient

# Check payment counts
print("Total:", ServicePayment.objects.count())
print("Pending:", ServicePayment.objects.filter(status='PENDING').count())
print("Paid:", ServicePayment.objects.filter(status='PAID').count())

# Check recent payments
recent = ServicePayment.objects.order_by('-created_at')[:10]
for p in recent:
    print(f"{p.service_type} | {p.status} | {p.patient_id} | {p.created_at}")

# Check patient statuses
patients = Patient.objects.exclude(current_status='COMPLETED')[:5]
for p in patients:
    print(f"{p.patient_id} | {p.current_status} | {p.current_location}")
```

### Check Frontend Console
- Open browser DevTools (F12)
- Check Console tab for errors
- Check Network tab for API calls
- Look for failed requests or unexpected responses

- Count displays correctly
- Can process payments

**Payment History - Completed Tab**:
- Shows all payments with status='PAID'
- Count displays correctly
- Includes file fees and processed service payments

**Patient Flow**:
- Consultation completion creates PENDING payment
- Payment appears in both Dashboard and Payment History
- Processing payment updates patient status
- Services unlock after payment

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No pending payments" but consultation completed
**Solution**: Check if payment was actually created:
```python
ServicePayment.objects.filter(
    service_type='CONSULTATION',
    patient_id='PAT123'  # Replace with actual patient ID
)
```

### Issue: Tab counts show 0
**Solution**: Check browser console for API errors. Verify backend is running.

### Issue: Old payments showing incorrectly
**Solution**: This is expected. Old payments (before implementation) may have incorrect routing. Focus on NEW payments created after implementation.

### Issue: Payment modal won't open
**Solution**: Check console for errors. Verify PaymentRecordModal component not throwing errors.
