# Payment Flow Architecture - WEMA HMS

## Current Finance Portal Structure (Existing UI)

### Pages Already Built:
1. **Dashboard** (`/finance/dashboard`) - Overview with stats cards and charts
2. **Payment Queue** (`/finance/payment-queue`) - Two tabs: "Pending Payments" & "Recent Payments"
3. **Daily Operations** (`/finance/daily-ops`) - Daily balance, expenses, outstanding bills

### Current Payment Queue Features:
- ‚úÖ Two tabs: Pending (Clock icon) and Recent (CheckCircle icon)
- ‚úÖ Search by patient ID/name/service
- ‚úÖ Filter by service type (Consultation, Lab, Medication, File Fee, Other)
- ‚úÖ Card-based layout showing payment details
- ‚úÖ Real-time polling every 3 seconds
- ‚úÖ Total amount calculation in header

---

## Current Issues
1. ‚ùå Payments created directly as PAID (file fees bypass queue)
2. ‚ùå No auto-creation of payments from doctor/lab/pharmacy services
3. ‚ùå Daily Ops page shows mock data
4. ‚ùå No payment ledger/history export
5. ‚ùå Missing payment method auto-detection for NHIF patients

## Proposed Unified Payment Flow (Minimal UI Changes)

### Core Principle
**Auto-create PENDING payments at each service point ‚Üí Finance approves via existing Payment Queue**

---

## Payment Journey (Using Existing UI)

```
Service Completed ‚Üí Auto-create PENDING Payment ‚Üí Shows in Payment Queue "Pending" tab
  ‚Üì
Finance staff clicks payment card ‚Üí PaymentRecordModal opens
  ‚Üì
Selects payment method ‚Üí Clicks "Record Payment"
  ‚Üì
Payment marked PAID ‚Üí Moves to "Recent Payments" tab ‚Üí Service unlocked
```

### Detailed Flow

#### 1. **FILE FEE (Registration)**
**Current**: Reception marks as paid immediately
**New**:
- Reception creates **PENDING** ServicePayment
- Patient gets temporary access to doctor queue
- Finance reviews and marks as **PAID**
- OR: Keep current flow (paid immediately) since it's a gate-keeping fee

**Recommendation**: Keep file fee as immediate payment (it's a prerequisite)

---

#### 2. **CONSULTATION FEE**
```
Doctor completes consultation
  ‚Üì
System creates PENDING payment for consultation
  ‚Üì
Patient status: PENDING_CONSULTATION_PAYMENT
  ‚Üì
Finance marks payment as PAID
  ‚Üì
Patient status changes to: TREATMENT_PRESCRIBED or PENDING_LAB_PAYMENT
```

---

#### 3. **LAB TESTS**
```
Doctor orders lab tests
  ‚Üì
System creates PENDING payment for lab tests
  ‚Üì
Patient status: PENDING_LAB_PAYMENT
  ‚Üì
Finance marks payment as PAID ‚Üí status: LAB_PAID
  ‚Üì
Lab processes tests ‚Üí status: LAB_COMPLETED
  ‚Üì
Results sent back to doctor
```

---

#### 4. **PHARMACY/MEDICATION**
```
Doctor prescribes medication
  ‚Üì
System creates PENDING payment for prescriptions
  ‚Üì
Patient status: TREATMENT_PRESCRIBED
  ‚Üì
Finance marks payment as PAID ‚Üí status: PHARMACY_PAID
  ‚Üì
Pharmacy dispenses medication
  ‚Üì
Patient status: COMPLETED
```

---

## Database Changes Needed

### ServicePayment Model (Already Exists)
```python
status = 'PENDING'  # Default for all new payments
status = 'PAID'     # After finance approval
status = 'WAIVED'   # If payment is waived (NHIF, charity, etc.)
status = 'REFUNDED' # If refund issued
```

### Auto-Create Payments (Backend Changes)

#### When Doctor Completes Consultation:
```python
# backend/doctor/views.py - save_consultation endpoint
ServicePayment.objects.create(
    patient_id=patient.patient_id,
    patient_name=patient.full_name,
    service_type='CONSULTATION',
    service_name='Doctor Consultation Fee',
    reference_id=consultation.id,
    amount=get_service_price('CONSULTATION'),  # From ServicePricing
    status='PENDING',  # KEY CHANGE
    processed_by=None  # Not yet processed
)
```

#### When Doctor Orders Lab Tests:
```python
# backend/doctor/views.py - create_lab_request endpoint
total_amount = sum([test.price for test in lab_tests])
ServicePayment.objects.create(
    patient_id=patient.patient_id,
    patient_name=patient.full_name,
    service_type='LAB_TEST',
    service_name=f'Laboratory Tests ({len(lab_tests)} tests)',
    reference_id=lab_request.id,
    amount=total_amount,
    status='PENDING'
)
```

#### When Doctor Prescribes Medication:
```python
# backend/doctor/views.py - create_prescription endpoint
total_amount = sum([med.price * med.quantity for med in medications])
ServicePayment.objects.create(
    patient_id=patient.patient_id,
    patient_name=patient.full_name,
    service_type='MEDICATION',
    service_name=f'Prescription ({len(medications)} items)',
    reference_id=prescription.id,
    amount=total_amount,
    status='PENDING'
)
```

## Finance Portal Enhancements (Minimal Breaking Changes)

### 1. Payment Queue Page ‚úÖ (Already Exists - Just Connect to API)
**Current State**: Has UI structure with tabs, filters, search
**Changes Needed**:
- ‚úÖ Connect to real API (already done)
- ‚úÖ PaymentRecordModal already functional
- üîÑ Add "Waive Payment" option in modal (small addition)
- üîÑ Add date range filter (Today, This Week, This Month)

**NO MAJOR UI CHANGES NEEDED**

### 2. Daily Operations Page üîÑ (Exists but needs API connection)
**Current State**: Shows mock data for daily balance, expenses, outstanding bills
**Changes Needed**:
- üîÑ Connect to real ServicePayment API for revenue calculations
- üîÑ Add payment ledger table (replace mock outstanding bills section)
- üîÑ Calculate closing balance from ServicePayment records

**UI Structure to Keep**:
- Three tabs: "Daily Balance", "Expenses", "Outstanding Bills"
- Stats cards at top
- Date selector

**Modifications**:
- Add "Payment Ledger" as 4th tab OR
- Replace "Outstanding Bills" tab with "Payment Ledger"
- Add export button (Excel/PDF)

### 3. Dashboard Page ‚úÖ (Keep As Is - Just Update Data Source)
**Current State**: Shows revenue breakdown, payment methods, stats cards
**Changes Needed**:
- üîÑ Connect charts to real ServicePayment data
- üîÑ Update stats cards with live calculations

**NO UI CHANGES**

## Implementation Priority (Minimal UI Disruption)

### Phase 1: Backend Payment Auto-Creation (2-3 days)
1. ‚úÖ Update ServicePayment PAYMENT_METHODS (add NHIF) - **DONE**
2. ‚úÖ Remove notes field from payment modal - **DONE**
3. ‚è≥ Create helper function to auto-create payments with NHIF detection
4. ‚è≥ Modify doctor consultation endpoint to create PENDING payment
5. ‚è≥ Modify doctor lab request endpoint to create PENDING payment
6. ‚è≥ Modify doctor prescription endpoint to create PENDING payment
7. ‚è≥ Update patient status workflow to check payment status

**UI Impact**: NONE - Just backend changes

### Phase 2: Finance Portal API Connections (2-3 days)
8. ‚úÖ Payment Queue already working - **DONE**
9. ‚è≥ Add waive payment button to PaymentRecordModal
10. ‚è≥ Connect Dashboard charts to real ServicePayment API
11. ‚è≥ Update Daily Ops to show real revenue calculations
12. ‚è≥ Add date range filter to Payment Queue tabs

**UI Impact**: MINIMAL - Just adding a button and connecting existing UI to APIs

### Phase 3: Payment Ledger in Daily Ops (1-2 days)
13. ‚è≥ Add "Payment Ledger" tab to Daily Ops page (or replace Outstanding Bills)
14. ‚è≥ Create table showing all payments with filters
15. ‚è≥ Add daily summary section at bottom (closing balance)

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing (1 day)
17. ‚è≥ Test complete patient flow: Registration ‚Üí Doctor ‚Üí Lab ‚Üí Pharmacy
18. ‚è≥ Test NHIF auto-detection
19. ‚è≥ Test payment queue real-time updates
20. ‚è≥ Verify closing balance calculations

**Total Time**: 6-9 days (1-2 weeks)
**UI Breaking Changes**: NONE - Only enhancements to existing pages

## NHIF Auto-Selection Logic

### At Payment Creation:
```python
# Check if patient is NHIF type
payment_method = 'NHIF' if patient.patient_type == 'NHIF' else 'CASH'

ServicePayment.objects.create(
    ...
    payment_method=payment_method,
    status='PENDING'  # Finance still needs to verify NHIF coverage
)
```

### At Finance Approval:
- If NHIF patient, finance verifies card/coverage
- If covered ‚Üí mark as PAID with method=NHIF
- If not covered ‚Üí patient must pay cash (update method)

## Vital Signs Display Issue - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

### Issue: Only 4 vital signs showing (BP missing)
**Root Cause Found**: `PatientDetailSerializer` was missing `respiratory_rate` field in line 133

**Fix Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Added `respiratory_rate` to `PatientDetailSerializer.Meta.fields`
- ‚úÖ Added `patient_category` to same serializer
- ‚úÖ Added console logging to `PatientDetailsModal.tsx:86-97`

**Expected Result**: All 5 vital signs now returned by API:
1. Temperature
2. Blood Pressure (Systolic/Diastolic)
3. Pulse Rate
4. Respiratory Rate ‚Üê **NOW INCLUDED**

**Test Instructions**:
1. Login and view patient PAT69
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for log: `Patient data received: {respiratory_rate: 56, blood_pressure_systolic: 119...}`
4. All 5 vital signs should display in modal

**If still not showing**: Check console for actual API response structure

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test Current Fixes**:
   - Login and test finance portal access
   - View patient details to confirm all 5 vital signs show
   - Register new patient to test file fee flow

2. **Implement Phase 1** (if approved):
   - Modify doctor endpoints to create PENDING payments
   - Update patient status workflow
   - Test complete flow: Registration ‚Üí Doctor ‚Üí Lab ‚Üí Pharmacy

3. **Build Payment Ledger** (Phase 2):
   - Create new page with filters
   - Add daily summary
   - Test closing balance calculations

---

## Questions for Discussion

1. **File Fee**: Should it remain immediate payment or go through finance?
   - **Recommendation**: Keep immediate (it's a gate-keeping fee)

2. **Consultation Fee**: When should it be created?
   - **Option A**: When doctor starts consultation (before completing)
   - **Option B**: When doctor completes consultation ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED**

3. **NHIF Verification**: Should NHIF payments auto-approve or still need finance verification?
   - **Recommendation**: Still need verification (to check card validity/coverage)

4. **Waived Payments**: Who can waive payments?
   - **Recommendation**: Finance and Admin only

5. **Refunds**: Do we need refund functionality?
   - **Recommendation**: Yes, add in Phase 2
